Welcome to **Jan Ken Pon**! This is my **very first personal project**, and I'm really glad to share this fun, minimal, and interactive web application. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, it's the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game where you can play against a computer opponent and keep track of your score. Whether you're learning frontend development or looking for a mini-game to add to your portfolio, this is a great place to start.

## ⚙ How It Works

1.  When you make your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), the game immediately transitions to a comparison screen.
2.  A brief countdown starts, building anticipation for the computer's choice.
3.  The computer's choice is randomly generated using `Math.floor(Math.random() * 3)`.
4.  The result (Win, Lose, or Draw) is displayed, and your score is updated accordingly.
5.  You can then click "Play Again" to start a new round!

The entire game logic is written in **vanilla JavaScript** without any external libraries, and the visuals are handled with CSS for layout and responsiveness.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

This project was a fantastic way for me to understand and practice:

* ✅ Basic **HTML structure** and semantics
* 🎨 **CSS styling**, animations, and responsive layout techniques
* 🧠 **DOM Manipulation** in JavaScript (selecting, adding/removing classes, updating text content)
* 🔁 **Event Handling** (responding to user clicks)
* 🧮 Using `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()` for random number generation
* ⏱ Implementing **timed functions** with `setTimeout` for the countdown
* 📱 Making websites **responsive** for different screen sizes
