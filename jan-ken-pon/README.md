🎮 Play against a computer opponent

🔢 Dynamic score tracking

📱 Fully responsive – works on mobile and desktop

⚡ Lightning-fast with zero dependencies

👨‍🏫 Beginner-friendly code structure

🧩 Perfect for small JavaScript projects or code challenges

⚙ How It Works
User Choice: The user selects one of three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

Computer Choice: Simultaneously, the computer randomly selects its own choice.

Result Determination:

Rock beats Scissors

Paper beats Rock

Scissors beats Paper

If both select the same, it's a draw.

Score Update: The score is updated based on the round's outcome (win, lose, or draw).

Play Again: Users can easily play another round after the result is displayed.

The logic is written entirely in vanilla JavaScript without any external libraries. The game visuals are styled with CSS to maintain layout and responsiveness, providing an intuitive user experience.
